## Inspiration
Due to the effects of Covid-19 on in-person learning, many young students have had a hard time learning and practicing math online. These difficulties can be attributed to a lack of powerful and engaging resources dedicated to these younger audiences. Our project aims to help these students develop and maintain valuable math skills in a manner that is educational without losing the "fun" aspect of a game.

## How it works
The objective of the game is to progress through multiple worlds, meeting unique creatures on each. Every creature will ask a math question, which get progressively more challenging towards the final world. If you answer the question correctly, the creature will join you on your adventure, otherwise it will run away.

## How we built it
We used Java for the backend of the program, especially for the dynamic real-time question generator. Currently, a simple visual interface has been used to test the question algorithm, however an immersive game system is in the works using python and pygame.

## Issues we ran into
The main challenge that we had to face as a team was the amount of work that was necessary to learn and develop new skills for efficient and effective coding. Many of the functions that have been applied to our program were new concepts for many of us. Although difficult in such a short period of time, we matured as developers, and will be able to apply these skills in the future.

## What's next for the project
Currently, our main focus is to create an immersive game environment with graphics and other video game mechanisms. The end goal is a game that can be published and be played by young students around the world.
